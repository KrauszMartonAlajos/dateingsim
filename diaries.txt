Diary of Jake - December 12, 2024 -BOY1-

It’s been a strange day, and I’m not even sure where to start. I guess the morning’s as good a place as any. I woke up earlier than usual, not because I wanted to, but because Mom forgot to close the blinds last night. The sunlight streamed in like some kind of golden alarm clock, pulling me out of my dream. I don’t even remember what the dream was about, just that it felt nice. Waking up wasn’t so nice.

Anyway, I dragged myself out of bed and tried to avoid stepping on the chaos that is my room. My soccer cleats were tangled with my school bag strap, and a half-read comic book was lying open on my desk. Sometimes I think my room’s messiness reflects my brain—a jumble of random, half-finished ideas and plans.

Breakfast was the usual scene. My little sister, Emma, was sitting at the counter, already halfway through a bowl of cereal and babbling about her art project. Something about macaroni and glitter. I tuned her out after she used the word “unicorn” for the third time. Mom was rushing around with her coffee mug in one hand and her phone in the other, talking to someone about her work deadlines. Dad was nowhere to be seen, probably already off to his job downtown.

I scarfed down some toast and an apple, grabbed my stuff, and biked to school. The air was sharp and cold, the kind that makes your lungs feel alive when you breathe it in. I kind of like that about winter, even if I hate the slush and the way it turns my sneakers into soggy disasters.

School was… school. I guess it was fine. We had a science test in second period, which I think I did okay on. The questions about the water cycle were easy, but the stuff about chemical bonds? Total mystery. I wrote down what I could remember from last night’s cramming session, but honestly, I’m not holding my breath for an A.

Lunch was the best part of the day, as usual. I sat with my best friends, Ryan and Luis, in our usual spot by the window. Luis was going on about this crazy idea he has for a YouTube channel—something about building homemade gadgets. He even showed us a sketch he made of a soda-can launcher. It’s probably illegal, but it looked cool. Ryan, of course, was more focused on trying to get Sarah’s attention. She sits two tables away from us, always surrounded by her friends. Ryan’s been in love with her since seventh grade, but he still hasn’t worked up the courage to talk to her.

After lunch, we had gym class, and for once, it didn’t suck. We played indoor soccer, and my team crushed it. I even scored two goals, which felt amazing. Coach said something about how I should try out for the school team next year. I don’t know. I love playing soccer, but the idea of being on a team seems like a lot of pressure.

The rest of the day was a blur of classes and homework assignments. By the time the final bell rang, I was more than ready to head home. But as I was unlocking my bike, I noticed something weird. This kid—he’s probably in ninth grade—was sitting on the curb by himself, looking really upset. His name’s Ethan, I think. I’ve seen him around, but we’ve never talked. I almost just rode away, but something made me stop.

“Hey,” I said, walking over. “You okay?”

Ethan looked up, his eyes red and puffy. He shrugged and mumbled something I couldn’t hear.

I sat down next to him, even though the curb was freezing. “You don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to, but… if you do, I’m here.”

He hesitated for a moment before saying, “It’s just… some guys were being jerks. They took my hat and threw it in a puddle.”

“That sucks,” I said, because what else could I say?

We sat there for a while, not really talking, just existing in the same space. Eventually, Ethan stood up and said, “Thanks. For sitting with me.” I nodded, and he walked away. I don’t know if it made much of a difference, but I hope it did.

When I got home, Emma was in the middle of turning the living room into an art studio. There was glitter everywhere. I mean everywhere. Mom wasn’t home yet, and Dad was locked in his office, so I guess it was up to me to make sure she didn’t accidentally glue herself to the couch.

After dinner, I went up to my room to start on my homework, but my brain was still stuck on Ethan. I couldn’t stop thinking about how lonely he looked. Middle school’s hard enough without people going out of their way to make you feel small. I wonder if I should have said more, or done something to make him laugh.

It’s weird, though. Even as I’m writing this, I’m realizing that I felt good about talking to him. Like, maybe it wasn’t much, but it was something. And sometimes, something is enough.

Now it’s late, and I should probably go to bed. I’ve got another busy day tomorrow—science homework to finish, a soccer game to look forward to, and who knows what else. But for now, I’m just glad I took a moment to stop and sit with Ethan. Maybe tomorrow will bring another chance to do something that matters, even if it’s small.

Goodnight, Diary.

Diary of Liam – December 13, 2024 -BOY2-

The weird thing about today is how normal it started. I rolled out of bed with my alarm blaring in my ear—something I’ve been meaning to change for weeks now. That default ringtone is like nails on a chalkboard. Anyway, it was one of those mornings where everything felt slightly off, like I was walking around in someone else’s house. My toothbrush felt rougher, the cereal tasted stale, and my hair wouldn’t sit right no matter how much water I slapped on it.

Dad was already gone when I came downstairs. He had a flight to catch for some conference or other—he’s always flying somewhere. Mom was sipping her tea at the kitchen table, scrolling on her phone. She asked if I’d remembered to pack my science project, and I told her I had, even though I hadn’t. I grabbed it on my way out, the model volcano barely fitting into my bag.

The bus ride to school was boring, as usual. I sat near the window, trying to lose myself in the music on my headphones. Some old album I found last week. It’s kind of cool, the way old songs feel fresh when you’re hearing them for the first time.

At school, the day started dragging immediately. First-period math was unbearable, and Mr. Greene kept talking about proofs like they were the key to happiness. I was doodling in the margins of my notebook when I heard my name.

“Liam, would you care to share your thoughts on the problem?”

I stared at the board like it was written in an alien language. “Uh… could you repeat the question?”

A few kids laughed, but Mr. Greene just sighed and moved on. I think he’s given up on me at this point.

Things got a little better in history class. We’re doing this group project on famous explorers, and my group chose Sir Ernest Shackleton. I ended up researching him for hours last night—not because I had to, but because his story is incredible. He led this expedition to Antarctica, and when everything went wrong, he somehow kept his crew alive against all odds. I told my group about it, and even Sara—who usually spends the whole class texting—seemed interested.

Lunch was a mixed bag. I sat with the usual crew—Ethan, Josh, and Miles—but something felt off. Josh kept making jokes that were a little too mean, especially towards Ethan, who just laughed it off like he always does. I wanted to say something, but I didn’t. I don’t know why. Maybe I didn’t want to ruin the vibe, or maybe I just chickened out.

The afternoon flew by after that. We had an assembly about some new school policy—no phones in the hallways or something. The principal’s speech was so boring that half the auditorium was either asleep or whispering to each other. I spent the whole time thinking about Shackleton and wondering what it would’ve been like to be on his ship, stuck in the middle of an icy wasteland. Would I have been brave enough to follow him? Or would I have just given up?

After school, I had soccer practice. It’s been cold lately, so we practiced indoors, which is always weird. The ball moves differently on the gym floor, faster and less predictable. Coach kept yelling at us to communicate better, but honestly, we’re not bad. I scored a goal during our scrimmage, which felt awesome. Miles was goalie, and I could tell he wasn’t happy about it.

When practice ended, I walked home instead of taking the bus. I needed the air, I guess. The sky was this perfect mix of orange and purple, like the sunset was trying to paint something but couldn’t decide on the colors. I stopped at the park and sat on one of the swings, letting my legs dangle.

That’s when I saw her. Mia. She was sitting on a bench with her sketchbook, headphones on, completely lost in whatever she was drawing. I’ve liked her since sixth grade, but I’ve never worked up the courage to talk to her. I thought about saying hi, but what would I even say? “Hey, cool sketchbook”? Lame. So, I just watched her for a minute before heading home.

Dinner was fine. Mom made spaghetti, and Emma spent the whole meal talking about her class hamster, Mr. Nibbles. Apparently, he escaped his cage today, and it was a big deal. I think she’s more invested in his life than her own sometimes.

After dinner, I locked myself in my room and tried to focus on homework, but my brain kept drifting. I thought about Shackleton, and Josh’s jokes, and Mia sitting on that bench. It’s like all these little moments from the day were bouncing around in my head, refusing to settle.

I ended up writing a list. I do that sometimes when my thoughts get too loud. I just write everything down, no matter how random it seems. Here’s what I came up with:

Talk to Mia. Seriously, just say something. Anything.
Ask Josh to go easy on Ethan.
Look up more about Shackleton.
Figure out how to fix the stupid volcano before tomorrow.
Change my alarm tone.
It’s a weird list, but it helps. Seeing it written down makes it all feel a little more manageable.

Now it’s late, and I can hear Emma laughing at some cartoon downstairs. Mom’s probably asleep on the couch, and the house is quiet except for the faint hum of the heater. I like this time of night, when everything feels still and safe.

Tomorrow’s another day, and maybe I’ll cross a few things off my list. Or maybe I won’t. But for now, I’m okay with just writing it all down and letting it be.

Goodnight, Diary.

Diary of Noah – December 13, 2024 -BOY3-

Today was... well, it was a lot. One of those days that hits you in waves, like you’re standing at the edge of the ocean and you’re not sure if the next one is going to pull you under or just soak your shoes.

It started with the sound of Mom yelling up the stairs. “Noah, you’re going to miss the bus!” Typical. I barely had time to grab my hoodie before running out the door with a granola bar in my mouth. I know I shouldn’t skip breakfast, but mornings are chaos, and honestly, I’m just trying to survive until homeroom.

On the bus, my earbuds decided to stop working—again. So, instead of drowning out the noise, I got to listen to Tommy arguing with Jenna about some dumb TikTok trend. I swear, they could argue about the color of the sky if given the chance. I tuned them out as best I could, staring out the window at the frost-covered lawns. Winter’s definitely here, but it hasn’t snowed yet. There’s something kind of sad about that, like the world’s holding its breath.

School wasn’t any better. First period was biology, and we’re in the middle of this lab about ecosystems. I was supposed to work with Kai, but he barely showed up. When he finally dragged himself in 15 minutes late, he looked like he hadn’t slept in a week. “Rough night?” I asked, trying to keep it light.

He just nodded and mumbled something about his dad being on his case. I didn’t push. Kai’s been weird lately, quieter than usual. I guess we all have stuff going on, but it’s hard to know how to help when someone doesn’t want to talk.

By lunch, I was starving. I found a spot at the usual table with Jonah and Lucas, but things felt... off. Jonah was scrolling through his phone, barely saying two words, and Lucas was ranting about some game update that “ruined everything.” I tried to chime in, but they weren’t really listening. It’s funny how you can feel alone even when you’re surrounded by people.

The afternoon was a little better. In art class, Ms. Rivera asked us to paint something that represented how we were feeling. At first, I just stared at the blank canvas, thinking about how much I didn’t want to be there. But then I started mixing colors—blues and grays mostly—and ended up painting this abstract swirl that kind of looked like a storm. Ms. Rivera walked by and said, “That’s powerful, Noah. Keep going.”

I don’t know why, but that stuck with me. Maybe it’s because she actually noticed, or maybe it’s because I realized how much I needed to let some of that storm out.

After school, I had my shift at the library. It’s a quiet job, shelving books and helping people find stuff, but I like it. There’s this calmness to the place that makes the rest of the world feel less loud. Mrs. Chen, the librarian, always lets me work in the back when things are slow, and I spent an hour reorganizing the graphic novels.

At one point, this little kid came up to me with a book in his hands. “Do you have more like this?” he asked, holding up Percy Jackson and the Olympians.

“Yeah,” I said, smiling. “You’re gonna love the rest of the series.”

I showed him where they were, and his face lit up like Christmas morning. It was a small moment, but it felt good—like maybe I made his day a little better.

When my shift ended, it was already dark outside. The air was freezing, and I could see my breath in front of me as I walked home. I thought about texting Dad to pick me up, but I didn’t feel like dealing with his questions about school or what colleges I’m applying to.

Dinner was quiet, as usual. Mom asked if I had any homework, and I told her I’d get to it after I ate. My little sister, Grace, was babbling about some drama with her friends, and Dad was buried in his laptop. I picked at my food, not really hungry, and snuck back to my room as soon as I could.

Now I’m here, staring at the mess on my desk. Books, papers, a half-finished sketch from last week. I should clean it, but instead, I opened this notebook to write.

I keep thinking about what Ms. Rivera said. “That’s powerful.” I don’t feel powerful. Most days, I feel like I’m just floating through, trying not to screw up. But maybe there’s something to the idea of letting the storm out. I’ve been holding so much in lately—pressure from school, my friends drifting, Kai shutting me out. Maybe it’s time to do something about it.

Here’s what I’m going to try:

Check on Kai tomorrow. Even if he doesn’t want to talk, at least he’ll know someone’s there.
Finish that sketch. It’s been sitting there for too long, and I think I know what it needs.
Start writing more. Not just about my day, but about the stuff I can’t say out loud.
The heater just kicked on, and the house is quiet except for the hum of it. Grace is probably asleep, and Dad’s probably still at his laptop. I should get to bed, but I think I’ll sit here a little longer, letting the storm settle.

Goodnight, Diary. Tomorrow’s another chance to figure it all out.

Diary of James – December 13, 2024 -BOY4-

I don’t know how to start this. It’s not like I sit down and write in a diary every day—seems like something they’d make us do in English class. But tonight feels heavy, and I need to put it somewhere, so here goes.

The day started off okay, I guess. I woke up early for once, which meant I had time to eat breakfast. Dad had already left for work, and Mom was flipping through her email while I ate cereal. “Don’t forget about your math test,” she said as I grabbed my backpack. I nodded like I hadn’t been stressing about it for days.

The bus ride was... well, a bus ride. Loud kids in the back, quiet ones up front. I usually sit somewhere in the middle, where no one really bothers me. I had my headphones in and was halfway through a playlist when Tyler sat down next to me. “You ready for the game tomorrow?” he asked, grinning like he already knew my answer.

“Yeah,” I said, even though I wasn’t sure I meant it. Soccer’s always been my thing, but lately, it feels more like a chore than something I love. Tyler didn’t notice—I guess he was too busy talking about strategy or whatever.

By the time I got to school, the weight of that math test was back on my shoulders. Mrs. Pratt handed out the papers with her usual chipper smile, like she wasn’t about to ruin half our day. I stared at the first question, trying to focus, but my brain felt like it was moving through molasses.

I think I did okay. Not great, not terrible. But it’s hard to tell with math—you think you’ve got it, and then you find out you messed up one step and the whole thing’s wrong.

After the test, I felt wiped out, and it was only third period. Lunch didn’t help. I sat with Chris and Aaron like I always do, but they spent most of the time arguing about whether pineapple belongs on pizza. (It doesn’t, by the way.) I mostly just pushed my food around and tried not to think about anything.

The afternoon dragged. History class was all about World War II, and Mr. Martinez kept asking questions no one wanted to answer. I looked out the window and watched the clouds roll in, thick and gray. It felt like they matched my mood.

Then came practice. Coach was in one of his moods—barking orders, calling people out. “Liam, hustle!” he shouted at one point. I wanted to yell back that I was hustling, but what’s the point? We ran drills for what felt like forever, and by the end, my legs were jelly.

Tyler tried to hype everyone up afterward, but even he seemed tired. “We’ll crush them tomorrow,” he said, clapping me on the shoulder. I forced a smile, but all I could think was, Do I even care if we win?

When I got home, the house was quiet. Mom was still working in her office, and Dad wasn’t back yet. I microwaved some leftovers and ate in front of the TV, flipping through channels without really watching anything. Grace came home from her piano lesson and tried to show me the song she’s working on, but I wasn’t in the mood. She gave me a look—the one that says, “You’re a jerk,” without her having to say it—and went upstairs.

Now I’m sitting here, trying to figure out why everything feels... off. It’s not like anything huge happened today. Just the usual stuff—school, soccer, dinner. But it’s like there’s this knot in my chest that won’t go away, and I don’t know how to untangle it.

I think part of it is soccer. I’ve played since I was a kid, and I used to love it. But now it feels like everyone expects me to care as much as they do, and I’m not sure I do anymore. It’s not that I hate it—I just don’t feel the same spark. I don’t know how to explain that to Tyler or Coach without them thinking I’m giving up.

And then there’s school. Lately, it feels like every teacher is piling on more work, like they think their class is the only one we have. Between that and soccer, it’s like I never have time to just breathe.

I don’t even know why I’m writing all this down. Maybe it’s because I don’t feel like I can say it out loud. Tyler would just tell me to “man up,” and Mom would probably start asking a million questions. Dad would try to give me one of his pep talks, which usually makes me feel worse.

But here’s the thing: I don’t want a pep talk. I just want someone to listen without trying to fix me.

Okay, that sounded dramatic. Maybe I’ve been watching too many teen dramas with Grace. But it’s true.

I should probably go to bed. Tomorrow’s going to be a long day, and I need all the energy I can get. But before I do, I’m making a promise to myself:

Talk to Grace. She didn’t deserve me brushing her off earlier.
Be honest with Tyler, even if it’s just a little.
Take a minute—just one minute—to breathe.
The clouds are still out there, heavy and dark, but maybe tomorrow the sun will break through. Or maybe it won’t. Either way, I’ll be here, figuring it out one step at a time.

Goodnight, Diary.

Diary of Ethan – December 13, 2024 -BOY5-

I wasn’t going to write tonight. The day was nothing special, just the same routine. But there’s this thought I can’t shake, and I figured maybe writing it down will help.

The morning started like every other. Alarm goes off at 6:30, I hit snooze twice, and Mom bangs on the door at 6:45, yelling that I’m going to be late. By the time I dragged myself out of bed, my little brother, Jamie, had already demolished the kitchen. There were cereal crumbs everywhere, and somehow, he managed to spill milk and orange juice.

Mom was trying to clean up and pack his lunch while he ran laps around the living room. “Ethan, can you please take him to the bus stop?” she asked, looking frazzled. I grabbed my backpack and told Jamie to hurry up. He grabbed his Spider-Man lunchbox and bolted out the door like he was in the Olympics.

Walking him to the bus stop isn’t bad—it’s only a block away—but Jamie talks nonstop. Today, it was all about his upcoming school play. He’s going to be a tree. He’s oddly proud of that. “I get to sway back and forth,” he said, demonstrating with exaggerated movements. “Like this!”

When I got back home, Mom was already out the door for work, so I had the house to myself for about ten minutes before I had to leave. I made toast, ate it standing over the sink, and tried to mentally prepare for another day of school.

The bus ride was uneventful, as usual. I sat next to Nate, who was glued to his phone playing some new game. “Dude, you’ve got to try this,” he said, shoving the screen in my face. It looked like some kind of zombie survival thing. I nodded and said, “Cool,” even though I wasn’t really paying attention.

At school, the day blurred together. First period was English, and we’re reading Of Mice and Men. Mrs. Higgins made us read aloud, which I hate because it always feels like people are judging how you read. I got through my paragraph without stumbling, but it’s like the whole time, I was hyper-aware of everyone’s eyes on me.

Math was next, and that was just frustrating. Mr. Patel went over quadratic equations again, but it still feels like a foreign language. I asked him a question, and he gave me that look, the one that says, “You should know this by now.” I stopped asking after that.

Lunch was... weird. Usually, I sit with Nate and Connor, but they got into some dumb argument yesterday about whose turn it was to bring chips for our group project, so today they sat at different tables. I ended up eating alone, which wasn’t the worst thing. At least no one tried to steal my fries.

The afternoon wasn’t much better. Science was just notes and more notes. P.E. was dodgeball, and of course, I was one of the first people out. I just don’t have that killer instinct everyone else seems to have. Watching from the sidelines, I realized how loud the gym is—echoes of shouting, shoes squeaking on the floor, the constant thud of the ball hitting walls. It felt like it was all closing in on me.

After school, I walked home instead of taking the bus. I needed the quiet, and the weather wasn’t too bad—cold, but not freezing. The sky was that pale winter gray that looks like it might snow but never does. I took the long way, past the park where Jamie and I used to play when we were little. It was empty, just swings swaying in the wind.

When I got home, Jamie was already back. He was sitting at the kitchen table with a coloring book, humming some tune from his play. “How was school?” he asked without looking up. I said, “Fine,” and headed to my room.

That’s where I’ve been ever since. I told Mom I had homework, which isn’t entirely a lie—I do have homework, but I haven’t touched it. Instead, I’ve been sitting here, staring at the ceiling and thinking about this... heaviness.

It’s not like anything bad happened today. But it’s like there’s this fog in my brain, and no matter how hard I try, I can’t clear it. I keep wondering if other people feel this way. Like, does Nate ever sit in his room and feel like he’s stuck? Or Connor? Probably not. They always seem so sure of themselves, like they know exactly who they are and where they’re going.

I wish I could say the same.

Mom came in a little while ago to check on me. She asked if I was okay, and I said I was tired. She gave me that look—the one that says she doesn’t believe me but doesn’t want to push. “Don’t stay up too late,” she said before closing the door.

Now it’s just me, my desk lamp, and the sound of Jamie snoring down the hall. I should probably try to sleep soon, but I know as soon as I turn off the light, my mind’s going to start racing again.

Here’s the thought I can’t shake: What if this is all there is? School, homework, soccer, family dinners, repeat. Is that what life’s supposed to be? Because if it is, I don’t know how I feel about it.

Maybe tomorrow will be better. Maybe not. But I guess I’ll find out either way.

Goodnight, Diary.

Diary of Ben – December 13, 2024 -BOY6-

Today was one of those days where you just feel... off. Not bad, exactly, but like something’s not quite aligned, like wearing a shirt that’s a little too tight or hearing a song that’s slightly out of tune. I can’t explain it, but writing usually helps, so here goes.

The morning started with Dad yelling at the dog. Milo, our golden retriever, decided it would be a great idea to drag one of Dad’s shoes into the backyard and bury it. To be fair, Dad’s been leaving his shoes by the front door forever, so I don’t really blame Milo for thinking they were fair game. But, of course, Dad didn’t see it that way.

Mom tried to defuse the situation by offering to dig the shoe up herself, but Dad just grumbled something about responsibility and left for work. Milo, blissfully unaware of the chaos he caused, flopped onto the living room rug and started chewing one of his toys.

After that rocky start, I grabbed some toast and headed to school. The bus was as loud as ever. Kids shouting, phones blaring TikTok videos, someone laughing so hard they snorted. I put in my earbuds and tried to tune it all out. It didn’t really work.

First period was history, and Mr. Edwards gave us this massive project about the Industrial Revolution. We’re supposed to work in pairs, which is always a gamble. My partner ended up being Ava, who’s nice but a total perfectionist. She already had a list of ideas before I even opened my notebook. “We should make a model of a steam engine,” she said, as if that was a totally normal thing to suggest.

I nodded along, even though I have no clue how we’re going to pull that off. Maybe I can talk her into doing something easier, like a poster or a slideshow. I mean, who even knows how to build a steam engine?

The rest of the day was a blur. Math was okay—just review for the upcoming test. In art, Mrs. Greene made us sketch still lifes again. I swear, if I have to draw another bowl of fruit, I’m going to lose it. At least this time, we got to choose our own objects. I drew my water bottle, which sounds boring, but I tried to make it look cool by shading it a lot.

Lunch was the usual chaos. I sat with Josh and Luke, who spent the entire time arguing about some YouTube conspiracy theory. Josh thinks the moon landing was fake. Luke thinks Josh is an idiot. I mostly stayed out of it, but Luke’s right—Josh is definitely wrong.

P.E. was dodgeball again, which is basically a survival game for people like me. I managed to dodge for a while, but then Bryce, the captain of the football team, hit me square in the back. It didn’t hurt much, but it was embarrassing. He smirked and said, “Nice try, Ben,” like he was being a good sport, but it still stung.

After school, I had band practice. We’re working on a new song for the winter concert, and Mr. Martinez is being super picky about the tempo. I play the drums, so it’s basically my fault if the beat is off, but I swear he was yelling at me for things that weren’t even my fault.

By the time I got home, I was exhausted. Mom asked how my day was, and I gave her the standard “fine” answer. She didn’t press, which I appreciated. Dinner was spaghetti, which is one of the few things Jamie, my little brother, and I both like. Milo sat under the table, hoping someone would drop a meatball. Jamie gave him one when Mom wasn’t looking.

After dinner, I tried to work on my English essay, but I couldn’t focus. The prompt is about describing a moment that changed your life, but I can’t think of anything big enough. Most of my life feels like a series of small moments, none of which seem important enough to write about.

I ended up staring at a blank document for half an hour before giving up and switching to YouTube. I watched a few drum tutorials, which made me feel slightly productive, but not really.

And now here I am, writing all this down and wondering why today felt so strange. Maybe it’s just one of those days. Or maybe it’s because the end of the year is coming up, and everyone keeps talking about resolutions and goals. It’s making me think about my own, and I don’t even know where to start.

Sometimes, I feel like everyone else has it figured out. Bryce knows he’s going to play football in college. Ava’s already planning to go to MIT. Even Josh, with all his weird conspiracy theories, seems confident about who he is.

And then there’s me. I like drums, but am I good enough to do anything with that? I like history, but does that mean I want to study it in college? I don’t know. It feels like I’m supposed to have all these answers, but I don’t.

Anyway, I should probably wrap this up. Tomorrow’s another day, and maybe it’ll feel less... off. Or maybe it won’t. Either way, I guess I’ll deal with it.

Goodnight, Diary.

Diary of Ryan – December 13, 2024 -BOY7-

I’ve been thinking a lot about how people remember things. Like, what makes one day stick in your mind while others fade into the background? Some days just feel more... vivid. Today wasn’t one of those days, but I want to write it down anyway. Maybe in the future, I’ll read this and feel something I missed in the moment.

The alarm went off at 6:30 as usual. I hit snooze twice, which I know is a bad habit, but it’s just so hard to get out of bed in the winter. The mornings are dark and cold, and my blankets feel like the coziest place in the world. But Mom knocked on my door at 6:50, reminding me I’d be late for the bus if I didn’t hurry.

Breakfast was toast and peanut butter—quick and easy. Mom was reading the news on her phone, and Dad was already out the door for work. I asked her if anything interesting was happening in the world, and she just sighed and said, “The same as always.” That’s Mom’s way of saying the news is too depressing to talk about.

School was... well, school. First period was biology, and we’re dissecting frogs this week. I’m not squeamish or anything, but I still felt kind of bad cutting into a frog. It wasn’t even about the grossness; it just seemed unfair that this little creature had to die so I could learn about its organs. Mrs. Talbot said something about respecting the process, but I don’t know. It felt weird.

Second period was Spanish, and we had a quiz. I think I did okay, but there was one question about irregular verbs that completely threw me. I guessed, so fingers crossed it’s right.

The highlight of the day was probably lunch, which is kind of sad if you think about it. I sat with Alex and Jordan, as usual. Alex was complaining about his geometry teacher, and Jordan kept making bad puns. At one point, Jordan said something so ridiculous I almost choked on my sandwich. It was nice, though—one of those moments where you forget about everything else for a little while.

After lunch, we had an assembly about college readiness. I’m only a junior, but they’re already trying to stress us out about applications and career paths. The speaker was this guy who kept using buzzwords like “networking” and “growth mindset.” I zoned out about halfway through and started doodling in the margins of my notebook.

When school finally ended, I walked home. It’s not a long walk—maybe 20 minutes—but it’s enough time to clear my head. I like the quiet of it, especially after a noisy day. The sky was this pale gray that looked almost like snow, but it didn’t smell like snow, if that makes sense. I know it’ll snow soon, though. You can feel it coming.

When I got home, Milo (our cat, not to be confused with the dog from next door) was curled up in my desk chair. He gave me this annoyed look when I tried to move him, like I was disturbing his very important nap. I ended up letting him stay and just sat on the floor while I did my homework.

Speaking of homework, I had way too much of it tonight. Math, English, and history all at once. Math wasn’t too bad—it was just some problems about exponential functions. English, though... we’re supposed to write an essay about a book that changed our perspective, and I have no idea what to pick. Do comic books count? Probably not.

History was kind of interesting, though. We’re studying the Civil Rights Movement, and the assignment was to analyze a speech. I chose Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream.” It’s such a powerful speech, even though I’ve heard it a million times before. There’s this one part where he talks about the “fierce urgency of now,” and that phrase has been stuck in my head all evening.

After dinner (chicken stir-fry—one of Mom’s specialties), I went outside for a bit. I like to sit on the porch and just listen to the world. Tonight, it was especially quiet. No cars, no barking dogs, just the faint sound of the wind in the trees.

That’s when I started thinking about memory again. Like, in 10 years, will I remember this moment? Will I remember how the air smelled, or the way the porch creaked under my weight? Probably not. But maybe that’s okay. Maybe not everything needs to be memorable to matter.

Anyway, it’s getting late, and I should probably go to bed. Tomorrow’s another day, and who knows? Maybe it’ll be one of those vivid ones that sticks with me. Or maybe it’ll be another ordinary day. Either way, I’ll be here, writing it all down.

Goodnight, Diary.

Diary of Ben – December 13, 2024 -BOY8-

I don’t even know where to start. Today was one of those days that felt like it stretched on forever, but now that I’m sitting here trying to write it all down, I can’t believe it’s already over.

The morning started off on a bad note. My alarm didn’t go off—again. I swear, if this phone gives me one more problem, I’m tossing it out the window. Anyway, I woke up to Mom yelling that the bus was about to leave. I grabbed whatever clothes were on top of the laundry pile, stuffed my books in my backpack, and bolted out the door without even brushing my hair.

When I got to school, my day didn’t get much better. First period was history, and Mr. Lawson decided to hand back our tests from last week. I thought I did okay, but apparently, “okay” was wishful thinking. He marked me down for some dumb formatting thing on the essay section. Honestly, who cares if I forgot to indent one paragraph? The content was good!

Second period was art, which I usually look forward to, but even that felt off today. We’re working on this big group project, and my partner, Amelia, kept insisting on using glitter. Glitter! It gets everywhere, and it’s impossible to clean up. I tried to talk her out of it, but she just gave me that “don’t be boring” look. I gave in because I didn’t feel like arguing, but I’m pretty sure I’ll be finding glitter in my clothes for weeks.

Lunch was... chaotic. The cafeteria ran out of pizza before I got to the front of the line, so I ended up with some questionable chicken nuggets. They were so dry I thought I might choke. I spent most of lunch trying to convince Greg not to make a scene over losing at Mario Kart last night. He’s such a sore loser, but it’s also kind of funny watching him rant.

The rest of the day was a blur. Math was boring, as usual. Mrs. Henry kept going on about proofs, and I swear, it’s like she speaks a different language. In English, we’re reading The Great Gatsby. I actually kind of like it, but I didn’t say that out loud because Alex would definitely make fun of me. He thinks liking books automatically makes you a nerd.

The best part of the day came after school. I was supposed to go straight home, but instead, I stopped by the park for a bit. It was empty, except for a couple of kids playing on the swings. I found a bench near the pond and just sat there for a while, watching the ducks paddle around. The air was crisp, and the sky was that soft, pale blue you only get in winter. It was peaceful, and I felt like I could finally breathe.

I pulled out my sketchpad and started drawing the ducks. They didn’t stay still for long, so most of the sketches were just quick outlines, but it felt good to do something creative without a deadline or a grade attached to it. I think I’ll go back tomorrow if the weather’s nice.

When I finally got home, Mom wasn’t too happy that I was late. She said something about how I need to take my responsibilities more seriously. I get it—I really do—but sometimes I just need a break, you know? Dinner was spaghetti, which was fine, but Jake (my little brother) kept slurping his noodles in the most obnoxious way possible. I told him to knock it off, and of course, Mom told me to “stop picking on him.” Typical.

After dinner, I went up to my room and tried to start my homework. I couldn’t focus, though. My brain kept wandering back to the park and how calm everything felt. I ended up doodling more ducks in the margins of my notebook instead of writing that chemistry lab report. It’s fine—I’ll do it tomorrow during study hall.

Now it’s late, and I’m lying here listening to the rain. It started about an hour ago, soft at first, but now it’s coming down pretty hard. There’s something comforting about the sound of it. Like, no matter how stressful life gets, the rain just keeps falling, washing everything clean.

I don’t know if today was good or bad. It was just... a day. But I think that moment at the park made it worth writing down. Maybe that’s the trick—finding those small pockets of peace in the middle of the chaos.

Anyway, that’s all I’ve got for tonight. Hopefully, tomorrow will be better. Goodnight, Diary.
